Ways to get help

```{r}
help("+")
?"+"
```

pre build data, data to practice

```{r}
data()
```

We can use pre-build data by using the name listed on data() result.

```{r}
CO2
```

We have also some constant pre-build in the code like:

```{r}
pi

```

```{r}
Inf
```

```{r}
99999999 > Inf
```

```{r}
help(Inf)
```

## Naming variables

words are separated by \_

```{r}
a <- -1
b <- 3
c <- 5

solution_1 <- (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/ (2 *a)
solution_2 <- (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/ (2 *a)

solution_1
```

## Comments

```{r}
## This is a comment

```

## Nested Function

Functions are evaluated from the inside out

```{r}
exp(1)
log(2.718282)

## nested function
log(exp(1))
```
